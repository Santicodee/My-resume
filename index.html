    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a college student majoring in metallurgical engineering. Although
      coding is not directly related to my course, I am passionate about
      learning it, especially in web development. I believe that coding skills
      are valuable in any field, and I am excited to see what I can create with
      them. I am confident that I can become a successful front-end developer,
      and I am committed to achieving my goal.
